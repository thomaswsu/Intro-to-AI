# Intro-to-AI
This is for an Intro to AI class I took at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. There are a lot of answers online already the homework for this class was taken from a open source UC Berkeley class so I don't think I'm helping anyone cheat... Anyways I think my code is nice.

This project is part of the Pac-man projects created by John DeNero and Dan Klein for CS188 at Berkeley EECS. We thank Pieter Abbeel, John DeNero, and Dan Klein for sharing it with us and allowing us to use as course project.
